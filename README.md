Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of a pattern printing program in C. It generates an inverted pyramid pattern based on the number of rows specified in the code. The program uses nested loops to print spaces and asterisks in the correct format.

Program Description
The program is divided into two main parts:

Regular Pyramid: The first part prints a regular pyramid pattern with the specified number of rows.
Inverted Pyramid: The second part prints an inverted pyramid pattern with the specified number of rows.
The number of rows for the pyramid is defined by a constant in the code.
